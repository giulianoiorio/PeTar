This example shows how to use the script pymake_unique_file to merge in a unique file the splitted outputs created by a SEVN run with more than one thread.
The script pymake_unique_file can be found in the SEVN folder pyscript (you put a copy on this folder  for simplicity) 
You can run it just typing 
chmod u+x pymake_unique_file 
and
./pymake_unique_file ../sevn_outputs_example/sevn_output_multi
Open the script to explore additional options that can be set directly inside the script

The output files are stored in ../sevn_outputs_example/sevn_output_multi
